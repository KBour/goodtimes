BHIS (Black Hills Information Security) / WWHF (Wild West Hackin Fest) Training: There are several “Pay what you can” trainings that are geared toward the blue team side of things. I’ve taken two of the three courses and really enjoy them.

(To get the training for free use the email address on the registration page to request the code, they don’t need a reason why it’s just to verify you intend to take the course.)
Bonus: If you attend all 4 days you get a certificate – great for resume building!
